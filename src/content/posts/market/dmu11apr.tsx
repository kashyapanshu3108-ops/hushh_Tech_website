          As we move deeper into earnings season, we're maintaining our balanced approach with significant cash reserves to capitalize on opportunities. Our focus remains on high-quality businesses with strong free cash flow generation that can weather potential economic headwinds.

          Technical indicators suggest increasing volatility ahead, which aligns perfectly with our "Sell the Wall" strategy. We remain positioned to benefit from time decay and fear-driven premiums in the options market.
